# PICASO (Picture Captioning System with AI)

The project's aim is to generate captions for input images by utilizing a dataset containing 8,000 images, each paired with five captions. Both image and text caption features are extracted and combined to predict the next word in the caption. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed for image analysis, while Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is utilized for text analysis.
